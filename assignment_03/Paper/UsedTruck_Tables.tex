\section{Data Description}
% 
A data engineer for several dealerships has gathered relevant and appropriate 
information, and organized a dataset concerning 9,861 sales involving a
trade-in of a truck at nine dealerships (some having more than one location), 
around one-half of which were sold at retail, while the other one-half were 
sold at auction.
% 
These data are contained in the file {\tt UsedTrucks.dat}, which is
available in the {\tt Data} folder.
% 
Each vehicle in the dataset is a row, while the columns correspond 
to the variables whose names and definitions are the following:
