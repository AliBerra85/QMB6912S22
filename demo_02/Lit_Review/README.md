# Literature Review


## The Market for Lemons


The Website [Policnomics](https://policonomics.com) has 
an appropriate [summary of the paper](https://policonomics.com/the-market-for-lemons/) 
and a simple numerical example of how a market can break down. 

They also have summaries of [asymmetric information](https://policonomics.com/asymmetric-information/), 
including symptoms such as [adverse selection](https://policonomics.com/adverse-selection/)
and [moral hazard](https://policonomics.com/moral-hazard/). 


Usually my first Google hit is 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org), 
which has a thorough [description of the article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons), 
including brief descriptions of
its critical reception and implications. 


I found this article on an educational Website 
for an online book called [Introduction to Economic Analysis](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introduction-to-economic-analysis/index.html):
[Market for Lemons](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introduction-to-economic-analysis/s19-01-market-for-lemons.html)


A short YouTube video describes the situation nicely:

## Hedonic Pricing Models

The [Corporate Finance Institute](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com) 
has a summary, including some limitations of the modeling approach:
[Hedonic Pricing](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/hedonic-pricing/).
Their motivation for studying these models is for the valuation of securities. 

[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com) has a similar review 
[here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedonicpricing.asp), 
which cites Sherwin Rosen's article as the original reference.

In another application, 
[Ecosystem Valuation](ecosystemvaluation.org/)
shows a case study of an empirical project to measure the value of
environmental amenities near homes:
[Ecosystem Valuation: Hedonic Pricing Method](http://www.ecosystemvaluation.org/hedonic_pricing.htm). 





## Characteristic Theory for Product Demand


An online library called [Social Science Libre Texts](https://socialsci.libretexts.org)
has an interactive Webpage called 
[Lancasterâ€™s (1966) Characteristics Model](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Economics/Book%3A_An_Interactive_Text_for_Food_and_Agricultural_Marketing_(Thomsen)/05%3A_Consumer_Theory_and_Models/5.03%3A_Section_3-). 
This is a good review because it focuses on the economic foundation of the idea:
it shows that Lancaster aimed to explicitly model 
the relationship between prices and characteristics
from the choices of consumers. 
This page also refers to Rosen's hedonic pricing models as an extension. 


Incidentally, I found an article that claims to produce 
["a formal refutation of  Lancaster's theory"](http://bowbrick.org.uk/Publications/Refuting%20Lancaster's%20Characteristics%20Theory.pdf) 
of pricing based on characteristics. 
However, I feel that the author misses the point...of both the theory itself
and of economics in general. 
It is worth talking about for context
when it comes to using the scientific method in the social sciences.
